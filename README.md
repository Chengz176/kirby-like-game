# Kirb Run
## Description
Kirb Run is a Kirby-styled game implemented with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/), and [React](https://react.dev/), and built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). This project was based on the repo and tutorial[[2](https://github.com/Chengz176/kirby-style-game#references)] created by [JSLegend](https://github.com/JSLegendDev), and additional features and modifications were implemented. The main purpose of this project is to learn and have some experience on TypeScript and different packages, frameworks, and algorithms.

## Details About the Game
- Spritesheet is from the repo created by JSLegend
- The player controls a character called Kirb to explore the map and the goal is to reach the exit door
- There will be enemies to prevent player from reaching the door
  - **Guy**: The enemy wanders around on the platform
  - **Flame**: The enemy that can jump and throw fireballs
  - **Bird**: The enemy that flies around where a truncated normal distribution sampler, implemented based on the algorithm proposed by Nicolas Chopin[[1](https://github.com/Chengz176/kirby-style-game#references)], is used in determining the direction to fly
- Kirb can inhales enemies, shoot stars, and absorb abilities from enemies
- There will be a timer to keep track of time and a mini-map to keep track the position of the player relative to the map
- Each map is generated by a map generator implemented with references on WFC SimpleTiledModel[[4](https://github.com/Chengz176/kirby-style-game#references)] and N-WFC[[5](https://github.com/Chengz176/kirby-style-game#references)].
- The map generator can generated the map with a seed generated by a pseudorandom number generator implemented based on Lehmer random number generator [[3](https://github.com/Chengz176/kirby-style-game#references)].
- Two different game modes
  - **Select Map**: Play a specific map by providing the seed of the map
  - **Rounds**: Play a certain number of rounds where the map of each round is generated by the generator
